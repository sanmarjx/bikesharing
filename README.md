### Visualizations

![Tableau 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116690861/219949608-b247760f-afec-4ce2-b7c8-edf88c3b4467.png)


- The gender breakdown chart shows that 65% of users are males and 25% are female. In the heat my we observe that both males and femaales use the bikes around the same times.


![Tableau 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116690861/219950056-4634feec-9336-4234-9878-3172875c3677.png)



- This charts show more evidence that males use the program much more than females.

- Yearlong subscribers make up 81% of the rides.

- Monday through Friday are the most popular days while morning and evening commute are the most popular hours.

- This graph also shows that that the peak hours are during the morning and evening commute. It also shows that the best time to perform bike maintenance is during the hours of 1:00 and 5:00 a.m. since that is when the bikes are least used. 



![Tableau 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116690861/219950797-ecdb9e4c-d122-43cc-a2ca-ecf2e4c27e2b.png)



- Younger users ride the bikes for longer periods of time. 

### Summary
The analysis performed gave us an insight to the NYC Citibike bike-sharing program. Most of the rides were used during commuter hours which tells us that the users are probably commuters choosing the citibike over public transportation. It would be beneficial to see if this data is similar during the winter months. In addition the weather might impact the user activity so bike-sharing data in relation to weather will also be important to determine the viability of starting the bike-sharing business in Des Moines.
